        <h1>Hello, I’m Albin Milton</h1>
        <p>
          I build clean, accessible web interfaces and love learning new things.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an aspiring full-stack developer with a solid foundation in
        front-end technologies like HTML and CSS, and I’m currently expanding my
        knowledge of JavaScript to bring more interactivity and functionality
        into my projects. My journey into web development started with a
        curiosity about how websites are built and has grown into a full
        commitment to mastering both the front-end and back-end of web
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        What drives me is the balance between creativity and logic that coding
        offers. I enjoy designing layouts that look clean and responsive while
        also focusing on how everything works behind the scenes. Every project I
        take on is an opportunity to practice problem-solving, improve my
        skills, and push myself a little further than before.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to become a well-rounded developer who can build applications
        that not only work seamlessly but also create a great user experience.
        Along the way, I’m diving into new technologies, experimenting with side
        projects, and constantly challenging myself to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I like exploring the latest trends in tech, learning
        from other developers, and staying curious about how digital tools shape
        the way we live and work. This continuous learning mindset keeps me
        motivated and helps me bring fresh ideas into every project I work on.
